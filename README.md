# 👨‍💻 Intern-Proj: Software Development Task Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of web development tasks completed during an internship, focusing on building practical, functional web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains **five distinct projects** (Task 1 to Task 5), demonstrating skills in UI/UX, fundamental programming logic, and problem-solving within a web environment.

## ✨ Individual Task Details

### **Task-1: Temperature Converter (`Temp_conv.html`)**
* **Description:** A simple utility application for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Basic **JavaScript logic** for calculations, handling user input, and updating the DOM (Document Object Model).

### **Task-2: Number Guessing Game (`Guess_no.html`)**
* **Description:** A classic interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a set range.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** **Conditional logic** (`if/else`), **random number generation**, and providing immediate user feedback.

### **Task-3: Contact Form (`contact.html`)**
* **Description:** A static or functional contact form template, often including basic form validation.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** **HTML form elements**, **CSS styling** for layout and responsiveness, and basic **front-end validation** (if implemented).

### **Task-4: Sudoku Game (`sudoku.html`)**
* **Description:** An interactive implementation of the popular Sudoku puzzle game.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Complex **JavaScript logic** for game rules, board generation/validation, array/grid manipulation, and event handling.

### **Task-5: Web Scraping Front-End (`webScraping.html`)**
* **Description:** Likely a front-end interface or demonstration page for a web scraping concept. *Note: Pure client-side HTML/JS can only scrape content from the same domain due to security restrictions. This task focuses on the UI/display aspect.*
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Potential integration with a back-end API (if applicable) or a focus on designing the interface to display scraped data.
